			<h3>Breakfast of Champions</h3>
			<p>Ever since I could chew I've always had a pop tart for breakfast. Usually along side a glass of chocolate milk. Over the past two weeks I've been limiting the amount of sugar I've been eating trying to make my body healthier but I knew I wouldn't be able to kick the pop tart breakfast.</p>
<p>I was perusing Pinterest and found a recipe for some protein/energy bites that didn't have any sugar added and didn't have any strange ingredients. That's one of the hardest things about Pinterest, I might find something that sounds good but I have idea where to find the ingredients for it. This recipe was easy and quick but I didn't think it would be filling, but I tried it out any way.</p>
<p>Here's what you need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups of oats (I used the Quaker brand)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of honey (I used raw honey)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of peanut butter ( I used Jif natural PB)</li>
    <li>1 tsp. vanilla</li>
    <li>1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips</li>
  </ul>
<p>Use your food processor and grind the oats up so the are much smaller than their original size. Then dump the oats,honey, peanut butter, and vanilla in a bowl and stir together. Once mixed add in chocolate chips. Mix again. Then roll into balls. I made smaller balls and made about 12-20. Put in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. (I lined mine up on wax paper-but they're not sticky.) I eat 5-6 for breakfast and they keep me full at lest until lunch. A way better alternative to my two pop tarts (that didn't even fill me up!).</p>
<p>I am loving this recipe if your having a hard time cutting out sugars from your breakfast or snacks try these out!!</p>

			<h3>Finding the Beauty</h3>
			<p>So many article and blogs have written things regarding the same topic I'm going to discuss. Dove has an entire campaign made on this premise.</p>
<p>Make-up. Beauty. What makes someone beautiful or even "presentable"? Is their a "standard"? Maybe. Should their be? Absolutely not.</p>
<p>Today I was told that I needed to be wearing blush to work. Ya'll, I've never worn blush in MY LIFE! Okay, twice. Once when I was a child playing with make-up,experimenting. The second time when I went to a department store a month or so ago on a Saturday and tried out some new foundation and let the sales lady try blush just for fun. I've never owned blush of any kind and honestly I don't even know if I know how to put it on without looking like a clown. Evidently the last two months I have not been presentable enough at work. I'm sorry if you have a problem with the way I wear my make-up you shouldn't have hired me. Also make-up or certain types of make-up shouldn't be required in the work place. Especially if I'm the only person getting told to do so. But back to the beauty standard.</p>
<p>Why do I need blush?? I have fair skin so some clothes may make my skin feel a little paler. I don't tan. I don't have a lot of freckles. But yes I do still feel beautiful. And I refuse to let someone else have an opinion about my make-up or my clothes. They do not define me. This world does not define me. I do not define me. The Lord defines me. And here's what he has to say.</p>
<p>My favorite verse of all time:</p>
<p>"All beautiful you are my darling, there is not flaw in you" Song of Solomon 4:7</p>
<p>The Lord sees no flaw in me (or my make-up).</p>
<p>"Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised." Proverbs 31:30</p>
<p>Ladies, The Lord sees you as beautiful. I was extremely discouraged when I was told my look was not up to par. But you know what? Although those words still hurt the only person that matters is The Lord and he sees so much more in me than that. And He sees so much more in YOU than that. Don't let anyone tell you differently.</p>
<p>You are Beautiful.</p>
