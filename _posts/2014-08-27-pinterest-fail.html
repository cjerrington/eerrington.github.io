<p>I really enjoy wasting time on Pinterest. Mostly I look for new things to attempt to bake. A week or so ago I found a recipe for a Pazookie. If you have ever been to BJ's and have not had one you absolutely must the next time you're there. </p>

<p>They are delicious. After finding this awesome recipe I decided to try it out. My sweet husband even decided to help. As we began to make the delicious treat we realized that this was going to be a rather large cookie but stuck it in the oven for the recommended 18 minutes.</p>

<p>After more than an hour of taking it out of the oven and quickly putting it back we ended up with this...</p>

<p>A gooey mess of sorta-kinda baked cookie dough. Needless to say I got tired of trying to force it to cook. It was way to thick to cook through before the morning rolled around. Still I would definitely recommend making this to anyone BUT you will want to divide it into several different CorningWare dishes before you do.  </p>

<p>You live and learn.</p>
