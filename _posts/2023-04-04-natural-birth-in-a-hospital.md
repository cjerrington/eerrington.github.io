Hi friends! Welcome back to the blog!

If you follow me on social media you might have seen I announced a new class that I wrote and will be teaching May 2nd! I’m so excited about this class and I hope and pray it’s helpful to expecting parents in this fun, tiring and exciting season of life. My hope is that I am able to bring you some insight into natural birth and help you better understand birth so you are empowered to make the best decisions for you and your baby.

I think a lot of the reason behind wanting to create this class comes from my own experience with my own hospital birth. My first birth was fairly traumatic for me- although I didn’t realize it at the time. I was met automatically with a handful or more of interventions and when asked, "When do you want your epidural?", I politely told the nurse I wasn’t planning on getting one. I will never forget what she said next. It rocked me to my core and honestly I think its part of the reason my birth plan fell to pieces. She looked up at me and said, " Well, this is going to be the worst pain of your life. So when you change your mind you can let me know." In this moment I felt so unsupported and like I was never going to be able to have a baby without an epidural.

I never want another mom to feel unsupported like I did in labor. I want every mom to know her options and how to advocate for what she wants and feels comfortable with, even if people around her don’t agree.

In the Natural Hospital Birth class we are going to discuss building a good birth team and how to prepare your birth team for the birth YOU want. We will also go over what "typical" hospital protocol looks like. I say "typical" because there are SO MANY variables when you arrive at a hospital, and things can change quickly in labor, but for the most part there is a standard you can prepare for. We will talk about how to handle pain in natural labor-first off, hire a doula. ;) Kidding!

Kind of.

We of course cannot talk about hospital births without talking through interventions and how to avoid the ones you really want to avoid and how to ask for help when you want it.

There really is so much to cover when discussing a natural hospital birth. I hope this class will be able to help many of you through the preparation stage of your labor and birth.

If you’re local and will be giving birth this year, I’d love for you to join us!
