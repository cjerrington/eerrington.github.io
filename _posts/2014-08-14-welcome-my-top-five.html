<p>Thanks for joining me on my blogging journey. If I'm being honest this isn't the first time I've  started a blog but hopefully this one will last longer. My hopes for my new blog are to share with you some things I love (my current top five things in this post) crafts and maybe even some recipes as I'm trying to expand my cooking and of course my baking skills as a new wife to my sweet husband.  To start this great adventure I'm going to give you the top five things that I recommend all of you to at least thing of trying.</p>
<p>5.Nook: I love to read and my nook makes everything about reading so much better. I have owned two. The first one I owned did not have a backlight which never caused any issues. So unless you're really into reading in the dark the Nook Simple Touch is a great buy for reading. Keep in mind the Nook Simple Touch is only for reading that means no Facebook or Netflix. This was a plus for me. When I sit down to read a book thats ALL I want to do...READ A BOOK, no distractions. Nook does make several tablets where internet features are available for those of you that need to be connected to those things at all times. I recently updated to the Nook Glow Light which is exactly like the Simple Touch except for one feature, the back light. At first I wasn't sure how I would like it but because it allows you to adjust the brightness and its not the same light as a computer screen, but a softer light, I do enjoy my new nook just as much as my old version. I have also been able to read a few text books for school on my Nook. Another plus to this great piece of technology almost every single book I have bought on my Nook is MUCH cheaper than the printed version and who doesn't want to save a little money.</p>

<p>4.Chacos: These are the best shoes ever. Hands down. I have never owned a more comfortable pair of Spring and Summer shoes. I got them about a year and a half ago and wear them every day that it's warm enough. So lately that has been every single day. They have so many colors and styles to choose from from simple black to multicolored. It can be hard to find them if you don't have a specialty store close to you. In Lubbock we have Mountain Hideaway (where I bought mine) that carries men and women's styles of theses great shoes. Chaco will also replace any broken soles or straps as well as change the straps out if you decide it's time for a color swap (and you get to keep your original soles)!</p>

<p>3. Erin Condren Life Planner: I might put this higher on my list if I had some more experience with mine. I just bought it a few weeks ago and so far I love it. Since I'm not back in school yet I haven't been using it as much as I will beginning in a few weeks. It is organized monthly and weekly with bright colors and cute quotes all over. Plus you get stickers to help highlight events, bills that need to be paid (we make use of that one in our house), birthdays and basically anything else you need to really stand out on a certain day. The covers are customizable (HELLOOOO MY FAVORITE PART) and they have all colors and several designs to choose from. You can even upload a photo it put on the cover. This year the life planners have covers that you can REMOVE and REPLACE with another! So if you get tired of one cover you can order another. My planner is 18 months so I could choose to change it out halfway though..just to make it interesting. Just as a warning if you are thinking of getting this cheap you will be disappointed. Good quality comes at a price and I invested quite a bit for this planner, but so far it has been well worth it. If you are on the fence about purchasing I would advise you to watch all the youtube videos that Erin Condren (yes, the namesake of the company) makes to show people her products(this is what helped me make the jump into purchasing).</p>

<p>2. May Designs : Okay, these last two things easily tie for first. I fell in LOVE with May Designs a little over a year or so ago. They also sell notebooks of ALL KINDS! Planners, address books, coloring book pages, diary pages, just about anything you can think of. MY first purchase was a planner which was great. Since then I've purchased a blank pages notebook, a meal planner, a lined notebook, a budget book, an address book....and I think thats it. They also sell cards that you can make into thank you cards. I've ordered those twice and made some into recipe cards. Within the last month they have come out with a whole new product line that includes save the dates and baby announcements! All adorable and guess what.....COMPLETELY CUSTOMIZABLE!!! You choose a pattern for the cover of your notebook (or card) and then you choose to monogram or have your name quote or anything else you can think of printed on the front. Now, adorable monogramed things come with a price. May Designs is by no means over priced. I feel if you want a good product you pay for it. These are great products and you wont be disappointed. I was a May Designs Campus Rep last semester and every person that bought a product from MD through me seemed to love it! I would HIGHLY recommend this company for my fellow notebook lovers!</p>

<p>ANDDDD THE MOMENT YOU'VE BEEN WAITING FOR</p>
<p>1. The Bobby Bones Show: No, this is not a TV show or something off of Netflix. It's a RADIO show. I had heard of the show once before but had never heard it. One morning last spring I turned on the radio in my car and there was a new morning show broadcasting " LIVE FROM NASHVILLE TENNESSEE", The Bobby Bones Show. Bobby, Amy and Lunchbox are the three main talents along with all their friends.I have to tell you these people have stolen my heart. I even find myself talking back to them sometimes (especially at the end of the show when they all yell "BYE" I always say it back...always). They are NORMAL people and actually make me feel like they are thankful I listen and they do all kinds of great stuff for charities and people. I cannot find the words to fully tell you how much I would recommend you listening to this show. They are the best. Seriously. Now that I've hopefully peaked your interest a little I'm sure you are going to rush to the nearest radio and try to find the show...but what if they don't carry it on your local radio station. Well I guess you're going to miss out....just kidding. If your local station doesn't carry the show, first you should protest until they DO carry it, but until then you can listen over the iheart radio app or on podcast. I do both! This show has made me interested in radio so much that I have been working towards getting an internship with Texas Tech's radio station KTXT this Fall, and it's all thanks to Bobby Bones and his crew. I would never have been this interested in radio if it wasn't for him.<br />
Listen. Enjoy. Thank me later.</p>
