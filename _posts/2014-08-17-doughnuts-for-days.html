title: Doughnuts for Days

<p>I LOVE to bake. I've been working towards being healthier so having a hobby such as baking can be hindered by heath goals. Thursday night I decided we needed a treat for breakfast so I set out to make something I had never tried before....doughnuts. </p>

<p>So after I ventured to  Bed Bath and Beyond for  two doughnut pans (because one pan only holds six) I began the adventure of baking doughnuts. I was a little worried because they contain Greek yogurt and I wasn't sure how that would affect the flavor but it actually turned out really well. While these don't taste like store bought glazed doughnuts they have been husband approved! </p>

<p>Here is the Recipe and at the bottom is the link to the blog that it originally came from!<br />
I did two things different from the original recipe. The first was I didn't have baking powder.....so I didn't use any. Obviously worked out just fine without it. The second thing I did differently was the the type of coffee I used. We didn't have any coffee other than K-cups so I just used a bold roast to help with the "strong" flavor. </p>
<p>I would recommend eating these the day after you bake them....they are much better on day two!</p>

Cut the tip off one corner and squeeze into the donut pan cavities. Fill at least 3/4 full. Bake at 375* for 9-10 minutes. Let cool in the pan for 2-3 minutes before removing to a wire rack. Cool completely.</p>
