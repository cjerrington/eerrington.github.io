<p>Ever since I could chew I've always had a pop tart for breakfast. Usually along side a glass of chocolate milk. Over the past two weeks I've been limiting the amount of sugar I've been eating trying to make my body healthier but I knew I wouldn't be able to kick the pop tart breakfast.</p>
<p>I was perusing Pinterest and found a recipe for some protein/energy bites that didn't have any sugar added and didn't have any strange ingredients. That's one of the hardest things about Pinterest, I might find something that sounds good but I have idea where to find the ingredients for it. This recipe was easy and quick but I didn't think it would be filling, but I tried it out any way.</p>
<p>Here's what you need:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 cups of oats (I used the Quaker brand)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup of honey (I used raw honey)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of peanut butter ( I used Jif natural PB)</li>
    <li>1 tsp. vanilla</li>
    <li>1/3 cup of mini chocolate chips</li>
  </ul>
<p>Use your food processor and grind the oats up so the are much smaller than their original size. Then dump the oats,honey, peanut butter, and vanilla in a bowl and stir together. Once mixed add in chocolate chips. Mix again. Then roll into balls. I made smaller balls and made about 12-20. Put in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. (I lined mine up on wax paper-but they're not sticky.) I eat 5-6 for breakfast and they keep me full at lest until lunch. A way better alternative to my two pop tarts (that didn't even fill me up!).</p>
<p>I am loving this recipe if your having a hard time cutting out sugars from your breakfast or snacks try these out!!</p>
