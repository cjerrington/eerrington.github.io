Hey there! Welcome to the blog! I hope the blog will answer some questions you may have and also give you some things to consider with your next pregnancy, labor and birth.

I thought we could start by getting to know a little about me! If you’re looking for a birth doula in the Lubbock area I would be so happy to get to meet with you so we can get to know each other. If you’re not local but are looking for a doula here are some great questions to ask them before hiring!

**Where are you from?**

- Originally San Angelo, TX but I’ve lived in Lubbock for 12 years now and call Lubbock home!

**Tell me about your family**

- I’ve been married to my husband Clayton for 8 years and we have to daughters.

**What did you do before you were a doula?**

- I’ve done a few different things! I was a nanny, worked in a business office and I’ve taught preschool for five years!

**Why did you decide to become a doula?**

- I have always loved birth and pregnancy. I think it’s incredible what our bodies are made to do and are completely capable of with the right support. I wanted to be able to help moms (and dads) be able to have the support they need to have the birth that they want for their family.

**What services do you provide?**

- I provide Birth Doula Services. I trained under Linda Herrick with the Academy of Certified Birth Educators and I am [DONA International Certified](https://www.dona.org/) and certified through the [Spinning Babies program](https://www.spinningbabies.com/).

**What is your favorite part about being a doula?**

- I love watching parents learn about birth and what they want their birth to look like. I love being able to empower them with the information they need to make the best decisions for their family.  Of course I love watching the babies be born too! Seeing babies take their first breath is nothing short of extraordinary!

**Do you only work at the hospital?**

- I can and have attended all types of births. I’ve worked at both of our local hospitals, our birth center and home births!

**How many clients do you take each month?**

- 1-2 depending on the month and my availability.

**Do you have a backup doula?**

- Yes! I work with several doulas in the area to make sure you are not left alone in case of emergencies.

**If you’re interviewing a doula, here are some more questions you could ask!**

- Can you doula for a C-section/VBAC/natural birth/medicated birth?
- What can you tell me about hospital interventions?
- Are there any interventions you can’t work with?
- What can you do to support my husband/family/children?
- Do you offer payment plans?
- What kind of things can we do if labor stalls?
- How often do you see longer/harder/complicated labors?
- What is your philosophy on birth?
- How many times will we meet with you before our labor and birth?

I hope all of this is helpful to those of you starting your search for a doula!

Blessings,

Emily
