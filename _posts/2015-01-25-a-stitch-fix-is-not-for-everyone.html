title: A Stitch Fix is Not For Everyone

<p>It's been awhile.....okay a long while since I blogged about anything but now I feel I have something to say!</p>
<p>Reading through some other blogs recently I found myself memorized by a little something called <a href="http://www.stitchfix.com">Stitch Fix</a>. Stitch Fix is a company that sends you clothes in the mail and you can send back what you don't like. It took me months to actually break down and try it, but last week I did and here are the results.</p>
<p>So like I said Stitch Fix will send you clothes and you can send them back if you don't like them. You just go online, create an account and fill out their style profile. I worked for days filling out my style profile making sure it was exactly how I wanted it so I would be sure to get some clothes I liked. I even chose the price range that each type of item I would be getting could be in.</p>
<p>Then this cute little box arrives in the mail a few days later.</p>

<p>And there were even instructions on the inside of the box.</p>

<p>And this is what I got!</p>
<p>I automatically set the jeans aside because I really don't need anymore. The blue dress was cute but looked HORRIBLE on my body type. My sweet, sweet husband who always says he likes my outfit, even said it was bad. Ha! The green sweater was cute but the sleeves were WAY to long and the sleeveless top was okay, but I won't be able to wear it for at least two or three more months and I wasn't crazy about the pattern. In the end the blue and white scarf is all I kept. Now, if you know me, you know I don't really need another scarf but here's where Stitch Fix gets ya. When you place a 'fix' (order) you are charged $20. If you keep an item the money goes toward that item, if you keep nothing the 'stylist' gets to keep it as a styling fee. Also, everything they sent me seemed a bit over priced. The scarf I ended up keeping was priced at $32!!!! I have never and will never pay that much for a scarf again. But it's cute!</p>

<p>The moral of this stitch fix story is unless you don't mind paying more for clothes or really don't have the time for shop for yourself and don't mind risking $20 then go for it. But for those of us just out of college trying to make it in this world I vote you skip it...unless you win the lottery.</p>
