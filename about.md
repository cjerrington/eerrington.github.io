<h2 id="content">Hey there, Mama!</h2>
<p>I’m so glad you’ve found me here in this space. Whether you’re a first time mom, a seasoned veteran, or maybe somewhere in between I hope you will find something here helpful on your journey to motherhood.</p>

<p>My name is Emily Errington and I have been a birth doula for the last year. I graduated from Texas Tech in 2014 and married my husband that same year. We have two girls that are a joy to watch grow. My husband and I are both from other parts of Texas but we lovingly call Lubbock home. </p>

<p>Becoming a birth doula was never the plan for me, at least not a first. I went to Tech for Media & Communication and planned to do some photography on the side. I was never truly excited for that career path, though.  I remember thinking, “I don’t really know what I want to do.” I even changed my major several times. </p>

<p>I was pregnant with my oldest in 2016 the first time I heard of a doula. I hired one to have with me during my labor and birth at the hospital. This was really my first introduction to what most refer to as “natural birth”. Coming out of that experience I was fairly disappointed in how my story unfolded and knew there had to be a better way. I went on to have a second birth in a hospital setting that was a bit redemptive for me (shout out to all the 2020 babies). </p>

<p>This is when I truly started to research birth, what a physiological birth can look like and how to achieve it. I was already fascinated by other women’s birth stories and I wanted to help women to be able to experience whatever kind of birth that they desire. </p>

<p>I signed up for my Doula training in April of 2021 and attended my first birth in July of that year. I never felt so in my element and confident in what I was doing as I did then. I knew this is exactly where I was supposed to be. </p>

<p>I would love to walk with you through this season in your life and guide you through the labor and birth that you envision. Whether your goal is a completely unmediated, physiological birth, or if you want an epidural sooner rather than later I can help you through the entire process! </p>

<p>I cannot wait to chat with you!</p>

<p>Emily</p>
